# 🛡️ PhishNet Extension (Demo Version)

PhishNet is a **demo browser extension** designed to showcase how phishing-detection tools can work.  
It simulates real-world features such as URL scanning, threat categorization, and user-friendly alerts — but **this version does not perform real security analysis**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Real-time URL Simulation  
Shows how an extension can scan user-entered URLs and classify them as:
- **Safe**
- **Suspicious**
- **Malicious**

### ✔ Threat Level Indicators  
Color-coded alerts give users a simple understanding of risk levels.

### ✔ Clean & Modern UI  
Demo interface showing how a phishing-detection extension might look in production.

### ✔ Lightweight & Fast  
Runs entirely in the browser — no backend or real scanning used in this demo.

### ✔ Fully Client-Side  
Only uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ⚠️ Important Note

It **does not**:
- Detect phishing attacks
- Check real URLs
- Connect to APIs
- Provide security protection  

It only **simulates** how a real extension would behave.
